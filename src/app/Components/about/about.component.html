  so. The client side was built using Angular 7 technology, the available
  courses are fetched from a database which is located at an "Azure CosmosDB
  Service". The Algorithm was coded in Python and the link between the client
  and the Python server is the MicroService: "Flask" which handles the requests
  to the server. This project was built by <b>Ron Wexler:   </b>
